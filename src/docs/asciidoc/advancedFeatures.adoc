== Mutualizing operator usage
From a clean code perspective, code reuse is generally a good thing. Reactor
offers a few patterns that will help you reuse and mutualize code, notably
for operators or combination of operators that you might want to apply regularly
in your codebase.

=== transform
The `transform` operator lets you encapsulate a piece of an operator chain into
a function. That function will be applied to an original operator chain at
assembly time to augment it with the encapsulated operators. So this applies the
same to all the subscribers of a sequence, and is basically equivalent to
chaining the operators directly.

[source,java]
----
Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> filterAndMap =
f -> f.filter(color -> !color.equals("orange"))
      .map(String::toUpperCase);

Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
	.doOnNext(System.out::println)
	.transform(filterAndMap)
	.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: "+d));

This outputs:

----
blue
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: BLUE
green
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: GREEN
orange
purple
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: PURPLE
----

=== compose
The `compose` operator is very similar to `transform` and also lets you
encapsulate operators in a function. The major difference is that this function
is applied to the original sequence *on a per-subscriber basis*. It means that
the function can actually produce a different operator chain for each
subscription (eg. by maintaining some state).

[source,java]
----
AtomicInteger ai = new AtomicInteger();
Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> filterAndMap = f -> {
	if (ai.incrementAndGet() == 1) {
return f.filter(color -> !color.equals("orange"))
        .map(String::toUpperCase);
	}
	return f.filter(color -> !color.equals("purple"))
	        .map(String::toUpperCase);
};

Flux<String> composedFlux =
Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
    .doOnNext(System.out::println)
    .compose(filterAndMap);

composedFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 to Composed MapAndFilter :"+d));
composedFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 to Composed MapAndFilter: "+d));

[[reactor.hotCold]]
== Hot vs Cold
So far we have considered that all `Flux` (and `Mono`) are the same: they all
represent an asynchronous sequence of data, and nothing happens before you
subscribe.

There are however in reality two broad families of publishers: *cold* ones and
*hot* ones.

The description above applies to the *cold* family of publishers. They generate
data anew for each subscription, and if no subscription is done then data never
start generating.

Think HTTP request: each new subscriber will trigger an HTTP call, but no call
is made if no one is interested in the result.

*Hot* publishers on the other hand don't really depend on any number of
subscribers. They might start publishing data right away, and would continue
doing so whenever a new `Subscriber` comes in (in which case said subscriber
would only see new elements emitted _after_ it subscribed). So for such hot
publishers, _something_ indeed happens before you subscribe.

One example of the few hot operators in Reactor is `just`: it directly capture
the value at assembly time, and will replay it to anybody subscribing to it
later on. To re-use the HTTP call analogy, if the captured data is the result
of an HTTP call then only one network call is made, when instantiating _just_.

To transform `just` into a _cold_ publisher, you can use `defer`. This will
defer the HTTP request in our example to subscription time (and would result in
a separate network call for each new subscription).

NOTE: Most other _hot_ publishers in Reactor are `Processor`.

Contrast these two other examples:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> source = Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
                          .doOnNext(System.out::println)
                          .filter(s -> s.startsWith("o"))
                          .map(String::toUpperCase);

source.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1: "+d));
source.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2: "+d));

Which outputs:

----
blue

Subscriber 1: ORANGE
purple

Subscriber 2: ORANGE

UnicastProcessor<String> hotSource = UnicastProcessor.create();

Flux<String> hotFlux = hotSource.publish()
                                .autoConnect()
                                .map(String::toUpperCase);


hotFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 to Hot Source: "+d));

hotSource.onNext("blue");
hotSource.onNext("green");

hotFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 to Hot Source: "+d));

hotSource.onNext("orange");
hotSource.onNext("purple");
hotSource.onComplete();

== Broadcast to multiple subscribers with `ConnectableFlux`
Sometimes, you don't only want to defer some processing to the subscription time
of one subscriber, but you might actually want for several of them to
_rendez-vous_ and *then* trigger the subscription / data generation.

This is what `ConnectableFlux` is made for. Two main patterns are covered in the
`Flux` API that return a `ConnectableFlux`: `publish` and `replay`.

 * `publish` will dynamically try to respect the demand from its various
 subscribers, in terms of backpressure, by forwarding these requests to the
 source. Most notably, if any subscriber has a pending demand of `0`, publish
 will *pause* its requesting to the source.
 * `replay` will bufferize data seen through the first subscription, up to
 configurable limits (in time and buffer size). It will replay these to
 subsequent subscribers.

A `ConnectableFlux` offers additional methods to manage subscriptions downstream
vs subscription to the original source. For instance:

 * `connect` can be called manually once you've reached enough subscriptions to
 the flux. That will trigger the subscription to the upstream source.
 * `autoConnect(n)` can do the same job automatically once `n` subscriptions
 have been made.
 * `refCount(n)` not only automatically tracks incoming subscriptions but also
 detects when these subscriptions are cancelled. If not enough subscribers are
 tracked, the source is "disconnected", causing a new subscription to the source
 later on if additional subscribers come back in.

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> source = Flux.range(1, 3)
                           .doOnSubscribe(s -> System.out.println("subscribed to source"));

ConnectableFlux<Integer> co = source.publish();

co.subscribe(System.out::println, e -> {}, () -> {});
co.subscribe(System.out::println, e -> {}, () -> {});

System.out.println("done subscribing");
Thread.sleep(500);
System.out.println("will now connect");

co.connect();

This outputs:
----
done subscribing
will now connect
subscribed to source

With `autoConnect`:

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> source = Flux.range(1, 3)
                           .doOnSubscribe(s -> System.out.println("subscribed to source"));

Flux<Integer> autoCo = source.publish().autoConnect(2);

autoCo.subscribe(System.out::println, e -> {}, () -> {});
System.out.println("subscribed first");
Thread.sleep(500);
System.out.println("subscribing second");
autoCo.subscribe(System.out::println, e -> {}, () -> {});

Which outputs:
----
subscribed first
subscribing second
