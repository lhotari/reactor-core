== Mutualizing operator usage
From a clean code perspective, code reuse is generally a good thing. Reactor
offers a few patterns that will help you reuse and mutualize code, notably
for operators or combination of operators that you might want to apply regularly
in your codebase.

=== transform
The `transform` operator lets you encapsulate a piece of an operator chain into
a function. That function will be applied to an original operator chain at
assembly time to augment it with the encapsulated operators. So this applies the
same to all the subscribers of a sequence, and is basically equivalent to
chaining the operators directly.

[source,java]
----
Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> filterAndMap =
f -> f.filter(color -> !color.equals("orange"))
      .map(String::toUpperCase);

Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
	.doOnNext(System.out::println)
	.transform(filterAndMap)
	.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: "+d));

This outputs:

----
blue
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: BLUE
green
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: GREEN
orange
purple
Subscriber to Transformed MapAndFilter: PURPLE
----

=== compose
The `compose` operator is very similar to `transform` and also lets you
encapsulate operators in a function. The major difference is that this function
is applied to the original sequence *on a per-subscriber basis*. It means that
the function can actually produce a different operator chain for each
subscription (eg. by maintaining some state).

[source,java]
----
AtomicInteger ai = new AtomicInteger();
Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> filterAndMap = f -> {
	if (ai.incrementAndGet() == 1) {
return f.filter(color -> !color.equals("orange"))
        .map(String::toUpperCase);
	}
	return f.filter(color -> !color.equals("purple"))
	        .map(String::toUpperCase);
};

Flux<String> composedFlux =
Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
    .doOnNext(System.out::println)
    .compose(filterAndMap);

composedFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 to Composed MapAndFilter :"+d));
composedFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 to Composed MapAndFilter: "+d));

== Hot vs Cold
[source,java]

Flux<String> source = Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("blue", "green", "orange", "purple"))
	.doOnNext(System.out::println)
	.filter(color -> !color.equals("orange"))
	.map(String::toUpperCase);


source.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1: "+d));
source.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2: "+d));

hotFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1 to Hot Source: "+d));

hotSource.onNext("blue");
hotSource.onNext("green");

hotFlux.subscribe(d -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2 to Hot Source: "+d));

hotSource.onNext("orange");
hotSource.onNext("purple");
hotSource.onComplete();
